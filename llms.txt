Fetch and analyze Kentucky public school enrollment data from the
Kentucky Department of Education (KDE).

## What can you find with kyschooldata?

**28 years of enrollment data (1997-2024).** 650,000 students today. 171
school districts. Here are ten stories hiding in the numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Jefferson County is Kentucky’s giant

Jefferson County Public Schools (Louisville) serves 95,000 students,
nearly 15% of Kentucky’s entire enrollment. It’s larger than the next
five districts combined.

``` r
library(kyschooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024)

enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students) %>%
  head(10)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Kentucky enrollment is slowly declining

Kentucky lost 25,000 students since 2015. The decline accelerated during
COVID and hasn’t reversed.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2015:2024)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Eastern Kentucky is emptying out

Appalachian coal counties have lost half their students since 2000. Pike
County, once 15,000 students, is now under 9,000.

``` r
appalachian <- c("Pike County", "Floyd County", "Letcher County", "Perry County")

fetch_enr_multi(2000:2024) %>%
  filter(grepl(paste(appalachian, collapse = "|"), district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. The Hispanic population has quadrupled

Hispanic students went from 2% to 9% of enrollment since 2000.
Lexington, Louisville, and central Kentucky drive this growth.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "hispanic") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. COVID hit Kentucky hard

Kentucky lost 20,000 students between 2020 and 2022. Unlike some states,
Kentucky has not recovered.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         end_year %in% 2019:2024) %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Fayette County is growing

While Louisville shrinks, Fayette County (Lexington) has grown to 42,000
students. Kentucky’s two urban districts are on opposite trajectories.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(grepl("Fayette County|Jefferson County", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = district_name, values_from = n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. 60% of students are economically disadvantaged

Kentucky has one of the highest rates of economic disadvantage in the
nation. In some eastern Kentucky districts, 90%+ of students qualify.

``` r
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "econ_disadv") %>%
  select(n_students, pct)

# Highest rates
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "econ_disadv") %>%
  arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students, pct) %>%
  head(10)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. Kentucky is 78% white

Kentucky remains one of the least diverse states. Louisville and
Lexington have significant minority populations; most rural districts
are 95%+ white.

``` r
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. Boone County is Northern Kentucky’s growth story

Boone County in the Cincinnati suburbs has added 5,000 students since
2010. It’s now the third-largest district in Kentucky.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(grepl("Boone County", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Independent districts are a Kentucky tradition

Kentucky has both county-wide districts (like Jefferson County) and
independent city districts (like Bowling Green Independent). Some
independent districts serve just 1,000 students but maintain their own
school boards.

``` r
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(grepl("Independent", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  arrange(n_students) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students) %>%
  head(10)
```
